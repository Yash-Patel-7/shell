Tests:
    1.  If given one argument, it will run in batch mode
    2.  If given no arguments, it will run in interactive mode

Batch Mode:
    1.  When given one argument, mysh successfully enters batch mode. This is proven by the absence of any
        any greetings and prompts in testSuite/A/2/outBAT.txt that would be required for Interactive Mode.

Interactive Mode:
    2.  When given no arguments, mysh successfully enters interactive mode. This is proven by the output of
        a greeting and prompt before reading the first command from stdin.
            a.  Note that in test.c, stdin is set to file testSuite/A/2/myscript.sh.
