Test:
Extension: Home Directory
	1.	The user’s home directory is obtained using getenv(“HOME”)
	2.	When cd is called with no arguments, it changes the working directory to the home directory
	3.	Tokens beginning with ~/ are interpreted as relative to the home directory.
			a.	The ~ is replaced with the home directory.

Both Modes:
	1.	mysh will successfully replace the ~ in tokens beginning with ~/ to the home directory. 
			a.	This is proven by the first output of p2/testSuite/E/1/outBAT.txt and p2/testSuite/E/1/outINT.txt, as they both contain
				the appropiate file stored in the file path given.
	2. 	When cd is called with no arguments, mysh will successfully change the working directory to the home directory. This is proven
		by the second output of p2/testSuite/E/1/outBAT.txt and p2/testSuite/E/1/outINT.txt, as they both contain the appropiate home
		directory.
