Tests:
    1.  After executing a command, mysh will print a new prompt
    2.  If the last command fails, print prompt “!mysh> ” and read the next command
    3.  Else print prompt “mysh> ” and read the next command


Interaction Mode:
    1.  If the previous command did not fail, for example, "echo hi", then the prompt written on a new line before 
        reading the next command is "mysh> ".
    2.  If the previous command failed, for example, "saldlk", which is not a valid command, then the prompt written 
        on a new line before reading the next command is "!mysh> ".
    3.  The appropiate prompts are printed based on the success of the previous command.
