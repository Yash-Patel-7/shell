Test:   mysh prints a message and terminates once it encounters the command

Interactive Mode:
    1.  The commands inputted before shell command exit into stdin will be read and executed sequentially.
    2.  When reading the exit command, mysh will print a message "exiting" that indicates mysh will terminate.
    3.  Any command inputted after shell command exit into stdin will not be read and executed.
    4.  This proves that mysh truly terminates after encountering shell command exit.
