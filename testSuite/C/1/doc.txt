Tests:   
1.  mysh prints a greeting before the first prompt 
2.  Before reading a command, mysh will write a prompt to stdout to indicate that it is ready to read input (“mysh> ”)
3.  mysh reads commands from stdin

Interaction Mode:
1.  There is a greeting "Welcome to MySH 3.0" before the first prompt written to stdout. 
2.  Executing multiple commands shows that this greeting is only written to stdout before the first prompt, 
    not before every prompt.
3.  After the greeting is written to stdout, a prompt “mysh> ” is written to stdout. 
4.  In testSuite/C/1/outINT.txt, the prompt is followed by the output of the command that was executed. 
5.  After the command was executed, the prompt is written to stdout once again to indicate that is it ready to read input.
6.  In test.c, stdin is set to file testSuite/C/1/myscript.sh.
7.  All shell commands entered in testSuite/C/1/myscript.sh are executed sequentially and written to stdout.
8.  This means mysh must be reading commands from stdin in Interaction Mode.
