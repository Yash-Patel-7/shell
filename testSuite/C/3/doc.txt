Test:   mysh terminates once it reaches the end of the input file

Interactive Mode:
    1.  testSuite/C/3/myscript.sh is empty, thus mysh will immediately reach the end of the file when reading from 
        stdin.
    2.  Thus after printing a greeting before the first prompt in Interaction Mode, and then writing a prompt "mysh> " 
        to indicate mysh is ready to read input, mysh will immediately exit.
    3.  Note that there is no exit command inputted into testSuite/C/3/myscript.sh, thus mysh recognizes that it has 
        reached the end of the file and terminates.
