Test:   If the command is not built-in and not a path, mysh checks the following directories in the same order for a file 
        with the specified name: 
        1. /usr/local/sbin
        2. /usr/local/bin
        3. /usr/sbin
        4. /usr/bin
        5. /sbin
        6. /bin 

1.  cat is an external linux command found in /bin that outputs the contents of a filename given as an argument.
2.  mysh will interpet cat as a command that is not built-in and does not contain a slash (/), thus it will check the
    appropiate directories in order, as shown in mysh.c. 
3.  Since cat is exectuable, mysh will execute cat and output no errors given that the appropiate arguments are given.
4.  If a file is found when searching through the directories listed above in order, but the file cannot be executed,
    then mysh will print an error message. This is shown in mysh.c.
        a.  As show in mysh.c, mysh will not continue looking in the remaining directories if a file is found, but cannot 
            be executed.
5.  If the command is not built-in, not a path, and not found in the directories listed above, mysh prints an error
    message (command not found: commandName)
