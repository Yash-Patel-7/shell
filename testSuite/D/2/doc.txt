Test:   The code interprets the first token of a command or sub-command as the program/built-in operation to execute. 

1.  The built-in commands exit, pwd, and cd are used to determine whether mysh interprets the first token of a 
    command or sub-command as the program/built-in operation to execute.
2.  The cd command successfully changes to the desired directory, as proven by the pwd command, which displays the present
    working directory.
3.  The echo command successfully displays the strings after echo
4.  mysh successfully identifies the first token as the command to execute and will not interpret other tokens as a 
    command/built-in operation.
