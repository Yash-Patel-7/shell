Test:   If an error is caused using built-in commands (ex: changing to a non-existent or inaccessible directory), mysh 
        prints an error message to stderr, and the last exit status is set to 1. 

1.  The built-in commands exit, pwd, and cd are used to determine whether mysh prints an error message to stderr when an
    an error is caused using built-in commands.
2.  The two errors caused by using the cd command is changing to a non-existent/inaccessible directory and passing in 
    more than 1 argument to the cd command. 
3.  The one error caused by using pwd is passing in any argument to the pwd command. Note that pwd does not take any
    arguments.
4.  The one error caused by using exit is passing in any argument to the exit command. Note that exit does not take
    any arguments.
